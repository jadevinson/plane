Simulations of the airplane boarding process

Copyright Jade Vinson 2016

Goal: Write simulations of the airplane boarding process to test hypotheses about how the order of passengers affects the boarding time.

We will be referencing and possibly building on the work of Jason Steffen

Think of this for now as a 'class project' for a self-designed curriculum to improve my
programming style.  The project was chosen based on these criteria:
* It iterests me, because I spend a lot of time in airplane boarding lines and it seems it could be done better.
* I'm comfortable sharing it with other programmers to get their insight on how to improve it.
* It's a self-contained but moderately complex and messy thing to program, and so learning to
code this well is a good exercise.
